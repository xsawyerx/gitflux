=head1 NAME

Git::Flux - A Perl port of gitflow

=head1 DESCRIPTION

We like gitflow and we like Perl and when we heard gitflow needs to be rewritten
in order to be more portable, we decided to get in gear.

C<gitflux> is the love child or Perl and gitflow.

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 new

Create a new object of Git::Flux.

=head3 dir

The directory which the Git::Flux instance will be working on.

You can also set this using the C<GITFLUX_DIR> environment variable.

=head3 repo

Internal L<Git::Repository> object that Git::Flux uses to do all the C<Git>
work.

You can construct your own and provide it on initialize.

=head2 run

=head2 create_repo

A small helper function to create a repository. The directory is taken from
the C<dir> hash key in the object. If one does not exist (that means it was
not provided in C<new>), it uses the current directory.
